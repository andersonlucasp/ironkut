## Introduction

Project of the second Bootcamp module of the IronHack school. Directed by: Anderson Lucas, Eduardo Lemes and Fernanda Delleprane.

The idea of this site was to combine all the features of our favorite social networks with the layout of the old Orkut.

This site was built using the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node and Handlebars.
